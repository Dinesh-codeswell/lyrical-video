# Changelog

All notable changes to LV-Gen are documented here.

---

## [0.1.2] — 2026-03-26

### Added
- Preview ↔ timeline sync: the timeline editor cursor now follows preview playback in real time, advancing smoothly with wall-clock interpolation and auto-scrolling via the existing "Follow playhead" setting. Cursor remains at the last position on pause for frame-accurate inspection of lyric timing.

---

## [0.1.1] — 2026-03-24

### Added
- Import Song dialog — create a new song's lyrics file directly from pasted text without leaving the app
- Title bar icon on macOS
- User manual (`docs/MANUAL.md`) with 15 sections covering installation, all GUI panels, tap-to-stamp workflow, theme editor, CLI reference, keyboard shortcuts, and troubleshooting
- Headless screenshot generator (`scripts/take_screenshots.py`) using `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` — all GUI panel screenshots committed to `docs/screenshots/`
- Automated HTML manual build in the release workflow — `LV-Gen-Manual-vX.X.X.html` now attached to each GitHub Release alongside the `.dmg`
- Code signing and notarization — releases are now signed with a Developer ID certificate and notarized by Apple; no Gatekeeper warning on launch
- New-user onboarding improvements

### Changed
- Removed Durt Nurs branding; app is now generic
- Build configs (`build.spec`, `setup_py2app.py`) now read version dynamically from `pyproject.toml` via `importlib.metadata` — no more hardcoded version strings

### Fixed
- Version mismatch between `pyproject.toml`, `build.spec`, and `setup_py2app.py`
- App crash on launch due to missing `imageio` package metadata in PyInstaller bundle (`importlib.metadata.version()` now resolved via `copy_metadata`)

---
